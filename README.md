* Clone this repo to view a sample project. All you have to do is add your project's API key when prompted on the screen.

## Steps
* [Add a 3D model](https://docs.echo3d.co/quickstart/add-a-3d-model) to the echo3D console.
* Open the project folder in VSCode and run it on a local server. You can also host this on your own server.

## Run
* After running on a server, show the camera the Hiro marker and your model should load slightly underneath it.
* [Add the API key](https://docs.echo3d.co/quickstart/access-the-console) for the model when prompted and choose the subproject.

Fun tip: Add/remove/edit models in the console and notice that the interactive models in the site change on reload.
