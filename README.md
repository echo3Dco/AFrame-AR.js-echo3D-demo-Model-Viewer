# AFrame-AR.js-echoAR-demo-Model-Viewer
An in-browser AR viewer of models from an echoAR console key, using AR.js and A-Frame. 

## Viewer Instructions
* The viewer needs a marker, which is by default the Hiro one (https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_rXmUhrNCt8/W0YImGVS1UI/AAAAAAAAECk/5uR-aSWdyx08jxRpRili6_B8D7NiCNHiQCLcBGAs/s320/hiro.png)
* <img src="/img/marker.png">
* Pull it up on your phone or print it out, and then show it to the camera. Your model should load slightly underneath it. 
* You can create your own marker here (https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html). 
* Or use NFT (natural feature tracking) by AR.js when it becomes more reliable with time.

## Register
* If you don't have an echoAR API key yet, make sure to register for FREE at [echoAR](https://console.echoar.xyz/#/auth/register).

## Setup
* [Add 3D models](https://docs.echoar.xyz/quickstart/add-a-3d-model) to the console.
* Either put in your API key on (https://ivan-v.github.io/AR.js-A-Frame-echoAR-demo-Model-Viewer/), or launch your own version of it with whatever modifications you wish.

## Run
* [Build and run the AR application](Locally, or on a server like https://ivan-v.github.io/AR.js-A-Frame-echoAR-demo-Model-Viewer/).

## Further
* A lot of cool things can be done with AR.js and three.js (which A-Frame provides full access to the three.js API).
* Here are some for your inspiration: https://stemkoski.github.io/AR-Examples/

## Real-time updates
Add/remove/edit models in the console and notice that the interactive models in the site change on reload.
